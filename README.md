### Usage

1. Create a new repo by [clicking here](https://github.com/davidteren/rails_6_template/generate)
2. In the ***Create a new repository from rails_6_template*** form add the name of your new applications repo and select ***Create repository from template***
3. Clone your new repo and cd into the directory
4. Run `bundle`
5. Run `yarn install --check-files`
6. Now you can run the following command to rename the app.

       rails g rename:into New-Name

7. Start `bin/webpack-dev-server` & `rails s` or run `foreman start -f Procfile.dev` to start everything including live-reload for browser updates as you save changes to view files.
8. Open one of the following in your browser [http://app_name.lvh.me:3000](http://app_name.lvh.me:3000/) or [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000/)

###  Generator Configuration
Some generators are disabled by default. See [config/application.rb](config/application.rb) for details.

 The jbuilder gem is also commented out by default.

---
### To DO

- Verify the renaming is thorough
- Set up the GemFile to more easily diferentiate between standard and template gems
- Consider automating added gem listing in readme & docs
- Renaming should remove all traces of template and add new app readme
